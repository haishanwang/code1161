TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week we are start to using Python actually. I am start to learn how to use Python. As I never use Python before, there are some challenges during the process of learning and doing homework. I found out the language use in Python, sometimes is not the same as we used the language in the life. Also, there are some difference in using number. For example, in Python, when you want to present 'first', but I need to use 'ZERO' to present it. Therefore, the way of order will be different and I should notice in the future study. During I did the homework, I found out there are some chanllenges. For example: the command like "return", it doesn't mean I press the 'return' button on the computer. It means type 'return' in Python. 'Five' is a number write in Python, not write English in Python. Exercise 1 and 2 are interesting. I found that there are many smalle details will make the file can't run. The process of found and fix errors is kind of fun. Exercise 3 is kind of hard. Due to there are some logic between number and formula. It takes some time to figure them out. 
The thing still unclear is sometimes I will confuse with variables and need time to figure them out.
