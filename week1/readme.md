TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned that installed the programs which can help me with programing in the days after. The process of install the programs is a little bit complicated. However, with the discovery by myself and help from Ishaan I finally figure out and finished the installation. I also learned and started to get in touch with Python and wrote down my first print in Python.


Thing I stil unclear is Python. The surface of Python is a little bit complicated for me, there are many content gather in one page. I feel worry about I can handle it.
